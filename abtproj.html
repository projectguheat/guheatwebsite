                    <h1>Urban Heat Islands (UHI) </h1>
                    <!-- <h3>Year 1</h3> -->
                    <p>World cities face a serious issue of consistent increase in temperature (Mora, et. al., 2017). The urban areas of developing countries, especially those with hot-humid climate like the Philippines, are vulnerable to excess heat. Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the most important challenges for the urban environment, especially in the context of global climate change. The urban population is particularly at risk from this phenomenon. UHI was first described in 1818 (Howard, 1818) when the city of London was then warmer than its surrounding suburbs. It occurs when a city experiences an increase of the sub-surface, surface, or air temperature than their undeveloped rural environment (Menberg et. al., 2013; Zhou et. al., 2011; Chow and Roth, 2006). Over the past two decades (1998–2017), the Philippines ranked fifth that was most affected by extreme weather events – storms, floods, heat waves etc. (Eckstein et. al., 2018) and recent work projected that the country could experience year-long heatwaves by 2050 under any of the potential emission scenarios (University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2017). As of 2014, 54 percent of the world’s population reside in urban areas and this amount is predicted to increase to 66 percent by 2050. Despite its lower level of urbanization, Asia accounts to 53 percent of the world’s urban population (United Nations 2014). Urban development accompanied by large population requires larger area for people to settle and inhabit thus replacing natural vegetation with buildings and structures. One of the largest problems associated with urbanization and industrialization of human civilization is the development of urban heat island (UHI). </p>

                    <p>Urban heat island (Ningrum 2018)</p>
                    <p>UHI is described as a microclimatic phenomenon where urban areas experience elevated air and surface temperature compared to the surrounding rural areas (Oke 1982). Built surfaces in these urban areas or cities are composed largely of non-reflective construction materials. As a consequence, these materials tend to absorb a significant portion of the incident radiation, which is released as heat. With little to no vegetation, these urban areas encounter a difficulty in cooling down. An illustration of this phenomenon is shown in Figure 2 (Ningrum 2018).</p>

                    <h1>Causes of UHI </h1>
                    <!-- <h3>Year 1</h3> -->
                    <p>There have been several literatures that measure and investigate UHI intensity. Some results showed that its magnitude varies depending on the season, procedure, and geographic location (Santamouris, 2015). The warming of urban areas is produced by a number of factors: natural landscape transformation, vegetation loss, presence of structures (e.g. buildings, roads and pavements), construction materials, population growth due to migration, and increased anthropogenic heat emission, among others. The work of Singh et. al. (2017) elaborated that the loss of vegetation raised the heat storage in the ground layer and built-ups contributed to a higher level surface temperature in urban areas as compared to surrounding rural areas. The low albedo materials in Budapest, Hungary showed to have a major contribution to UHI (Olah, 2012). Albedo is defined as the capacity of a surface to reflect sun’s energy or the ratio of the amount of sunlight an object reflects to the amount it absorbs (Gabler et. al., 2008). Low albedo materials absorb more solar energy, and therefore intensify the heat island while high surface albedo materials (e.g. lighter colored rooftops) reflect solar energy. A study on the surface temperature of a downtown area in Tehran, capital of Iran, was found cooler during daytime then higher during nighttime in a semi-arid city, where the surrounding rural environment is mostly barren soils (Haashemi et. al., 2016).</p>
